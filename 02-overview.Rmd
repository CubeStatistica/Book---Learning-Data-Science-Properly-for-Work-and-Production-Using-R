# Overview

## For a complete data science we need 4 aspects. 

Principals of Software development, Statistics, Development Operations. 


The technical tools you need learn to be able to work as a data scientist are:

1. DevOps
2. Statistical Computational Language (R, Python, Julia, etc.)
3. RMarkdown
4. Git Bash Command Line
5. GitHub
6. Docker
7. Data Bases
8. SQL
9. Principals of Visualization
10. 




The things you will need to learn how to do as a data scientist are:

__1. Practical Step 0:** Practically looking and understand the raw data. 
    1. How to look at raw data. 
    2. How to evaluate the raw data. 
    3. How to understand the raw data. 
__2. Theoretical Step 0:__ Knowing what format the data should be in to be able to visualize it, create tables of it's variables (and lastly to properly run models on it). 
    1. What format the raw data should be transformed into to visuals it. 
    2. What format the raw data should be transformed into to make tables to understand the data. 
    3. What format the raw data needs to be transformed into so that statistical, machine learning, predictive, and inferential models can be applied to the data. 
    4. 
__3. Practical Step 1:__ How to transform the raw data using SQL and your Statistical Programming Language like R.
