# Applications

Some _significant_ applications are demonstrated in this chapter.

We can just simply make basic Flexdashbaord by slecting Flexdashbard template in Rmarkdown. 

We can simply knit this as shiny using **runtime : shiny ** command.

We can add side bar in Flexdashbaord by just assigning as **Column {.sidebar}**.
