## Essential Visualization Principals

1. All visualizations must, at all times, have a title. No visualization should be without a title.

## Writing Visualization Titles. 

How to write a title of a visualization?

The title of a visualization should be such that when you little sister or brother reads the title he understands the visualization, or what the visualization is trying to represent. For example, for a bar chart the title could be "Bar Chart for Contractor Type". Bad title. But if you say, "The number of counts of the different types of Contractors." your younger brother or sister should be able to understand what the visualization is showing. 


## Bar Chart tips

1. Do not use grey to colour the coloumns. It just does not look really well. Better to use company theme, or just blue or some soothing actual colour.

2. In the axis, especially y-axis the numbers should not be displayed as 3e+05. They should be in the format what we call "pretty numbers".

3. In bar charts, the value of the bars should always be displayed either inside or just on top of the bars. 

4. If the bar chart has a lot of categories to display such as more than 25 and it is not reasonable to display so many categories of bar in one chart then, choose the top 6 or 10 categories in the variable to be displayed in the bar chart. 

5. For the bar charts I would not recommend using light colours. For example, I would not recommend using light blue, but rather simply blue. 

6. I would also recommend using high contrast colours. This makes visualizations look very good and appealing, in general (though there are exceptions).
