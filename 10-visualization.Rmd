# Bar Chart tips

1. Do not use grey to colour the coloumns. It just does not look really well. Better to use company theme, or just blue or some soothing actual colour.

2. In the axis, especially y-axis the numbers should not be displayed as 3e+05. They should be in the format what we call "pretty numbers".

3. In bar charts, the value of the bars should always be displayed either inside or just on top of the bars. 

4. If the bar chart has a lot of categories to display such as more than 25 and it is not reasonable to display so many categories of bar in one chart then, choose the top 6 or 10 categories in the variable to be displayed in the bar chart. 

5. For the bar charts I would not recommend using light colours. For example, I would not recommend using light blue, but rather simply blue. 

6. I would also recommend using high contrast colours. This makes visualizations look very good and appealing, in general (though there are exceptions).
