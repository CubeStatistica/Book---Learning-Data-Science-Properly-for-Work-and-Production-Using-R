# Bar Chart tips

1. Do not use grey to colour the coloumns. It just does not look really well. Better to use company theme, or just blue or some soothing actual colour.

2. In the axis, especially y-axis the numbers should not be displayed as 3e+05. They should be in the format what we call "pretty numbers".

3. In bar charts, the value of the bars should always be displayed either inside or just on top of the bars.
