## Correct Writing


First of all, I want to start by Titles. It is very important that you know how titles are written properly. You need to title you analysis, visualization, applications, sections, everything correctly. 

Every first letter in a title should be capitalized except for prepositions or connecting words like and, or, the, this. 
If we want to convert the phrase general useful tips to a title it becomes: General Useful Tips. 

Now, also, sentences should be written properly. The first word's first letter should be capital and the sentence should end with a period also called full-stop like this one.
