# The Command Line and Linux Terminal {#cmd}

## Chapter Primer

I had an entire chapter on git bash command line and you will see a lot of the same commands work exactly the same in the Linux command line (Terminal). In fact, git bash is a subset, or simplified or less powerful version of the Linux Terminal (Linux command line/Linux bash). There for there are several useful commands that work in Linux Terminal bash but not in git bash terminal. Just to mention a few here: cal, top, to name a few, work in Linux but not in git bash.

In fact, git commands and Linux commands should be used together. Hence, here I will be using both and teach more of git as well as Linux commands, as well as highlighting some difference between the two.


## Folder Organization

Spending a few seconds to properly name your folders and files will help you find your files more quickly later and it will look more professional.
Following are some points you should always keep in mind when creating & organizing folders and files.

**Point 1** Place the document in a single local drive.

**Point 2** Place all the documents related to a single project under a single “root folder”.

**Point 3** Being consistent in naming your folder by following a naming format will make it easier for you identify the correct folder especially if you have different projects of same company at a time. Choose a naming format and stick with it.
e.g. Company Name Project Name Date.

**Point 4** Some operating systems (such as Unix) do not allow spaces in file or folder names, so avoid this if your computing environment is mixed. Instead, use the underscores as a delimiter (e.g. Doe_John_Proposal.doc.) Other characters such as / ? < > \ : * | " ^ are also prohibited in file or folder names under Windows.

**Point 5** Use camel case.

**Point 6** Be descriptive in name but keep it short and logical.  Don't go overboard - file/path names have length limits which vary between operating systems. Under Windows the maximum full path length for a file (e.g. the drive letter + folder names + file name) is 260 characters.

Use common abbreviations wherever possible, such as Jan for January or Corp for Corporation. The goal when naming files is to be able to tell what the file is about without having to open it and look.# Git and Git Hub {#git}

First of all, I would like to say that command line and linux are amazing. It does things so simply and so easily it is almost as if you wave a hand a your room gets cleaned. You make a few hand gestures and wood, stone, and metal come together and assemble themselves into the frame of the house you have in mind. The ratio of the amount of effort you put in, the simplicity of the instructions and the accuracy of the execution to not what you say, but what you actually want is a kin to that of magic. So I write this ode in praise of the command line, Linux, and its predecessor Unix. 


## The Command Line

First please note that for the title the first letter of every word is capital except of connecting words which are not present. Also, since it is a Title it does not end with a period also called full-stop. 

Here are the basic commands to be used at the command line or terminal. 

## Essential Command Line Tips

Knowing these tips is essential because it increases productivity by so much and makes this much easier to do. 

1. **Tip Number 1:** When simultaneously working on two different projects, not even necessarily programming projects, then have two terminals or git bash terminals open each one cd'ed into the respepective project's working directory. 

I tend to work on two projects at the same time. This is what I found to be very productive for me. I know if I start becoming less productive i.e. start not having ideas, hit bottle necks, become very slow, then I know I can switch to the other project. Also, when I only have one project open I feel a lot more pressure, that as if I need to finish it or complete it quickly. By having two projects open I experience less stress and don't feel like if I am unable to progress in one then I am stuck. Have two projects open removes the feeling of only having one way forward and the fear of being stuck if that way is blocked. 

So when you have two separate coding projects running and you need to commit and push the changes to the GitHub, the amazing thing is to just have two git bash or terminals open with each being in one project and they run independently of one another. For some applications you cannot have two separate intinces running at the same time doing separate things. 



## Important Linux Terminal Commands

The main command is just looking what objects such as files and folders are in the current folder you are in. For this we use the `ls` command.


In linux terminal we can find what the day is displayed as a calendar. Simply run the command `cal`. 

```{bash, eval=F}
cal 
```

The data and time can also be displayed using the `date` command. 

```{bash}
date
```

We can also check the disk usage. The option `-h` list the disks and usage in human readable format. 

```{bash}
df -h
```

As you can see the information below is much less human reabable compared to the above the output.

```{bash}
df
```


We can also check the file sizes in the current folder.

```{bash}
du -sh *
```



Can check what is happening using:

```{bash, eval=F}
top

```

Now you can see that your Terminal screen has a lot of output at this point and is getting very cluttered. The command to clear is simply: `clear`

```{bash, eval=F}
clear

```

What we can also see not only what is in the current folder by typing the `ls` command but we can also see what is in some other folder, for example in the folder called `temp`.

```{bash, eval=F}
ls -lah /tmp
```

I will now explain the general structure and form of Linux commands.

## Structure and Format of Linux Commands

All Linux commands will have the general format:

Structure: `command -option target` E.g.    : `   ls   -lah     /tmp `

The `option` and the `target` are like the arguments the command (e.g. the Linux function) takes.

In fact, one easy way of finding all terminal commands in Linux is to simply move into the `/usr/bin` folder and then run `ls` command. It will give you a list of all the commands. 

```{bash}

cd /usr/bin
ls -l

```

You could have also just run `ls` instead of `ls -l`. The `-l` is the option saying display the list in long form.

Now if you first run the `ls` command you will not see the /usr/bin folder appear in the list.

To get back to where you were, which I assume you were in the root directory simply type `cd`

```{bash}
cd
```

Now you do not need to always `cd` into this folder if you need to print all the commands. 

Can you write the command that will list all the commands staying in the current library.

You have to use the general Linux command format.

Here it is:

```{bash}
ls -l /usr/bin
```

You can see the same format of: `command -option target_folder`



## More Useful Terminal Commands in Linux

The `which` command is very useful.

```{bash, eval = F}
which python
```

You can also create a file using the `touch` command


```{bash}
touch test.txt
```



You can also see what is written in files. You can use the `cat` or the `less` commands. 

Cat prints everything to the console.

```{bash}
cat test.txt
```

`Less` does not and allows you to move up and down using the keyboard arrows.

```{bash}
less test.txt
```


Another very useful command the `wc`. This is the word count command and it counts the number of words in a file.


```{bash}
wc test.txt
```

We can also create a director


```{bash}
mkdir newfolder
ls
```

You can also see that it has a different colour that shows it is a folder. 

We can also make a folder with subfolders within it. The way we do this is we have to choose the option `-p` followed by all the folders and subfolders.


```{bash}
mkdir -p newfolder/sub1/sub2
ls
```

Again, if you forget to put the `-p` it will not succeed in making the sub folders. 

My question here is, if you forget the `-p` will it still create the main folder `newfolder` or will that also fail?

```{bash}
mkdir newfolder2/sub1/sub2
ls
```

You should try this. Answer is the command will fail in it's entirety. No folders will be created.

We also have very useful commands to move files `mv` and delete, i.e. remove files using the command `rm`. 

Now to delete a director (i.e. folder) you need add the option -rf in the `rm` command. For example: `rm -rf dir_name`

This removes the entire directory tree or folder tree.

Finally, I want to mention the command `ps` which is processes. This prints the current processes that are running. 

```{bash}
ps
```

For example, the above prints the following. 

  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    9 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  321 pts/0    00:00:00 ps

One thing I would like to mention is the the `ps` command in git bash gives a different output.


### How to name git branches.

Most branches you will create will add some feature to the code. What feature to add will be assigned and described in the jira ticket. Jira ticket will be of the form: CS-150. 

Therefore, the name convention for a branch as above would be like this: feature/CS-150. Please not that the 'f' in feature needs to be lower case - not 'F' like Feature/CS-150.

This is the branch name. Notice, the first thing is what type of edit is being done, followed by forward slash and lastly the jira ticket. 

Other types of code edits could be 'debug' or 'test' instead of feature. Thus, those branches would be named as follows: debug/CS-150 or test/CS-150

# How to clone a repo from GitHub

# Step 0: cd into folder where you want to clone repo.
# Step 1: Open “Git Bash” and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.THEN
git clone #{repository URL}
# cd into the repo you just cloned.


# Create new local branch that you will work on. 

After cloning a remote repository to your local drive & before working on it you should create a branch in your local repository with Git Bash. If you don't do that it will create an error called "Merge conflict" with main branch.

# Step 0: Open "Git Bash" in where you cloned the remmote repo.

# Step 1: Type command 
git branch branch_name.

# Step 2: To switch among branches 
git checkout branch_name.

# Step 3: To check in which branch currently working in/list of all branches 
git branch. 


git branch branch_name #creates-new-branch


# Publish branch created in local repo to GitHub repo. 

git push -u origin branch_name #Publishes local branch to remote GitHub branch. 
# Now start work in the folder/directory - repo.
# And always type git status before you type anything else. 


# Add work to local git repo

git add .


# How to commit to the local repo and push to remote repo.

git commit -m "commit_msg" #repo-updation-msg


# Add committed work to remote github repo from local git repo.

git push
