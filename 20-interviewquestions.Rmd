Review 1 - Accepted Offer - Positive Experience - Average Interview

There were 3 rounds : first, a general resume based. Second, machine learning related basic questions, and third was the live coding round on python and SQL. Each round consist of 2-3 leadership principles questions towards the end.

1. How to decide k value in KNN
2. Explain unsupervised learning techniques which do not involve clustering
3. Diff techniques to assess multicollinearity (correlation, VIF, tolerance etc)

Review 2 - Accepted Offer - Positive Experience - Average Interview

The whole process took 2+ months.
I applied online for L4 and was contacted by the recruiter the next day. I was scheduled a phone screen interview. Upon passing that I was scheduled an Amazon loop interview consisting for 5 interviews back-to-back. After about 5 days I was notified that I passed and was upgraded to L5. A week after that I was matched with my future team and sent an offer, which I accepted.
Throughout the whole process the recruiter acted professional and kept me updated at each step. The team was very friendly. Overall, the best interview experience I'd had.

"Tell me about the time..." questions.
SQL easy to medium questions.
How to interpret OLS Regression output?
Explain confidence intervals.
Business acumen kind of questions.
