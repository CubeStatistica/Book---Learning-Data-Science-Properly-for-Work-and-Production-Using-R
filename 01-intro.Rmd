# Introduction {#intro}


Hello Everyone! Hope you all are doing well. 

My hope is to help you become a data scientist via this book that you would otherwise need to learn to become by being hired and trained at a proper machine learning company. 


This book's examples and specific code is run on a window's operating system and is done using R.
